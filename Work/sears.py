#Letâ€™s solve the following problem:
#
#One morning, you go out and place a dollar bill on the sidewalk by the Sears tower in Chicago.
# Each day thereafter, you go out double the number of bills. How long does it take for the stack
# of bills to exceed the height of the tower?

bill_thickness = 0.11 * 0.001 # Meters (0.11 mm)
sears_height = 442 # Height (meters)
num_bills = 1
day = 1

while ((bill_thickness * num_bills) < sears_height) :
    num_bills *= 2
    day = day + 1

print(day)
